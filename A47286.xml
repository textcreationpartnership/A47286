            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As in our material Building the Timber and Stones can have no ſutable place, until the Skilful Artificer hath throughly hewen, cut, and ſquared them: Even ſo in that ſpiritual and heavenly Building, <hi>(not made with hands)</hi> we cannot be <gap reason="foreign">

Again, as in the one, the greateſt and goodlieſt piece of Timber endures the greateſt ſtreſs, as being moſt entruſted and charged with the weight
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33652:4"/>and burden of the Building: So likewiſe in that other, it pleaſeth God oft-times to lay the hardeſt preſſure, and heavieſt weight of affliction and miſery, upon his beſt Saints, and moſt dearly beloved Children. But, Why doth he ſo? Why doth he moſt afflict, and lay his hand heavieſt on, thoſe that are neareſt and deareſt unto him? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> will reſolve this Queſtion; <hi>Ideo juſti premuntur</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut preſſi clament, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes exaudiantur:</hi> To no other end and purpoſe doth God ſuffer his untainted <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> and ſpotleſs <hi>Daniels</hi> to be flung into pits and priſons, dens and dungeons of deepeſt calamity, than that they ſhould <hi>de profundis clamare,</hi> from thoſe depths call and cry unto him, and in his good time find relief and inlargement from him.</p>

            <p>And looking but a little further, we may deſcry an <hi>Eſau</hi>'s feet ſwiftly poſting on in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33652:4"/>the revengeful perſuit of his Brother <hi>Jacob.</hi> If there be an <hi>Elijah,</hi> a Prophet, and Man of God, there will ſoon ſtart up a <hi>Jezebel,</hi> a Daughter of <hi>Belial,</hi> fiercely to perſecute him: If an <hi>Amos,</hi> an <hi>Amaziah,</hi> to proſcribe and baniſh him the Court; and if a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Saul</hi> too, to toſs him and hunt him to and fro like a Partridg in the Mountains.

Heavineſs may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning: The rod of the ungodly, though it fall, yet ſhall it not reſt upon the righteous; and albeit many and manifold be their troubles, yet in time the Lord delivereth them out of all, and encompaſſeth them about with ſongs of deliverance, as he did Royal <hi>David</hi> in this place.</p>
            <p>The Pſalm is wholly gratulatory, wherein the Prophetical King, and Kingly Prophet, and ſweet Singer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doth ſolemnly commemorate and chant forth not only the

            <p>The Text conſiſteth of three general parts.

            <p>God never gives a good Man a ſingle or ſolitary Bleſſing, but at the ſame time makes him as well thankful as happy: Hence we read of Altars erected and built by <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and other Patriarchs and holy Men of Old, as Monuments of their dutiful Gratitude unto God for Bleſſings lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them.

Which payment by words is not more eaſie than true, it being a Gift which both accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies a Bleſſing, and is One. And this ſociety of Bleſſings our Underſtanding may obſerve, even in thoſe things which are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33652:6"/>without underſtanding: The Doves, at every grain they pick, look upward, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thanks: the Jewel, which is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Sun-beams, coloureth the beams: and the Earth which receiveth moiſture from the Sky, repays it back again in vapours and exhalations; and each good Tree returns Thanks, as it were, for its goodneſs, by its fruitfulneſs: yea, the very Rocks and Stones, which receive a ſound from the Air, (before it be fully given) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it by an Eccho.

            <p>In all things then let us give Thanks, and ſtill return all Bleſſings and Benefits unto his Praiſe and Glory, from whoſe grace and favour they have been derived.</p>
            <p>In all things (ſaid I) let us give Thanks? All giving of Thanks is not acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Read we not of the Phariſee in the Goſpel, and of the form of his Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving? how he ſtood up moſt pertly, and

His Thankſgiving was ſo far off from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God, that it was utterly rejected as moſt abominable. What ſayeſt thou, proud Phariſee? Art thou not like other Men? Art thou no Extortioner, in the firſt place? I ſay thou art, and in the very denial thereof thou granteſt it; for whereas thou crackeſt and boaſteſt of thy Purity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and glorifieſt thy ſelf ſo much in thine own Works and Worth, thou proveſt thy ſelf an Extortioner, and a notorious one too; for thou wreſteſt and extorteſt the Glory from God, of which he hath ſaid,<note place="margin">Eſay 48.11.</note> 
               <hi>He will not give it to another.</hi>
            </p>

In the firſt of <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk,</hi> at the 15 and 16 Verſes, we meet with the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth, who when they <hi>took up all with the Angle, and catched it in their Net, and gathered it in their Yarn; they then Sacrificed to their Net, and burnt Incenſe to their Yarn, as if by them their Portion became fat, and their Food plentiful.</hi> That is, They flattered themſelvs, and gloried in their own Wit and Strength, as if thereby they had gotten all their Victories, with increaſe of Wealth, and Honour, and what not? and ſo they robbed God of his Glory. In requital of the like Ingratitude, when ſuperſtitions People, in the time of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> aſcribed unto their Lovers, (that is, to their Idols) the gift of their Bread and Wine, Corn and Oyl, Wool and Flax, Silver and Gold; then Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God returned in high diſpleaſure, <hi>and took away his Corn in the time thereof, and his Wine in the ſeaſon thereof,</hi>

               <hi>and recovered his Wool and his Flax, which he had lent them for a time to cover their nakedneſs withal.</hi> The right Praiſe and Thankſgiving indeed is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtinguiſhed from the Phariſaical and falſe Honour, by the Object: The one being
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33652:10"/>ſtill fixed and terminated on God, the other on our Selvs, or ſome ſecondary Agent. Therefore both devoutly framed, and rightly levell'd, was that Confeſſion of the Church, <hi>Eſay</hi> 26.12. <hi>Omnia opera noſtra operatus es tu Domine; All our works haſt thou wrought in us, O Lord:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Non nobis; Not unto us, O Lord, but unto thy Name, be the Praiſe.</hi> Now the falſe Honour hath ſtill ſome ſubordinate Agent or ſecondary Means for its Object; thus <hi>Nebuchadonoſor</hi> vaunts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the height and Tropick of his Pride, ſaying of <hi>Babylon, Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built,</hi>

Thus, as it is in the 10 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> verſe 15, the Hatchet and the Saw magnifie themſelvs againſt the Workman, when ſecondary Means rob the firſt Agent of his Honour. Thus (in a word)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33652:11"/>every fooliſh and vain-glorious Perſon exalteth himſelf, and, like an empty Scale, quickly mounts upwards; whereas the Wiſe man, like the fuller and weightier one, ſtill inclines downward in all Humility, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it the greateſt Argument of his ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, to diſclaim all Self-ſufficiency, and his higheſt Perfection, to confeſs his Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and thus, with our Royal Prophet here, he maketh God (as in all Right and Reaſon he ought) to be the proper Object of his Praiſe and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>And ſo from the Object of <hi>David</hi>'s Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, I proceed to his Motives or Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereunto, God's Benefits; <hi>All his Benefits towards him. [What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits towards me?]</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33652:15"/>who hath directed the heart of a moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious and faithful Counſellor (much like to another <hi>Huſhai,</hi> or <hi>Nehemiah</hi>) to contrive the happy means, and pave the way, for our Deliverance. Bleſſed be God, who hath ſtirred up the Spirit of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and magnanimous Chieftain (like a ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Cyrus</hi>) to effect it, and bring it to paſs, by reſcuing us out of thoſe miſerable Calamities and Diſtractions which we ſo long groaned under, and by reſtoring us to our antient Freedom, with all the juſt Rights and Immunities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Tell me, O ye Redeemed of the Lord, ye that yet ſtand amazed at the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Deliverance; Tell me, Men and Brethren, and all that hear me this day, How can we ſufficiently aeſtimate, or worthily priſe ſo rich a Bleſſing? What Return ſhall we make unto the Lord for This, and all other his Mercies, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof is numberleſs, and their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure beyond all meaſure? Aſſuredly, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſomething we muſt; for this is the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33652:15"/>Nature and Property of Him, who is <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus Maximus,</hi> our beſt and greateſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, who openeth his hand, and filleth every thing living with his Goodneſs, and <hi>giveth us all things richly to enjoy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> That as in conferring Benefits he is moſt libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and free; ſo is he likewiſe a moſt juſt and ſevere Exacter of his ordinary Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Thanks:</hi> Not becauſe he any ways ſtands in need of any thing from us; (for, <hi>if thou be righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 35.7.</note> 
               <hi>what giveſt thou Him? or what receiveth he at thine hand?</hi>) but becauſe it is his moſt juſt and lawful Due, he demands it; requiring the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation and Return of our Duties for our own Good and Benefit, and not for any Advantage of his.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>let our Mouth</hi> (as holy <hi>David</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth us) <hi>be filled with thy Praiſe all the Day long, O Lord.</hi> What is that (ſaith devout St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>All the Day long;</hi> but without intermiſſion? <hi>In prosperis, quia conſolaris; in adverſis, quia corrigis; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tequam eſſemus, quia feciſti; cùm eſſemus, quia ſalutem dediſti,</hi> &amp;c. In proſperity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33652:16"/>becauſe thou comforteſt us; in adverſity, becauſe thou chaſtiſeſt us; before we were, becauſe thou created'ſt us; when we were, becauſe thou preſerved'ſt us; when we had ſinn'd, becauſe thou forgaveſt us; when we turned unto thee, becauſe thou drawed'ſt us; and if we perſevere, becauſe thou wilt crown us.</p>
            <p>Thus, even thus, let our Mouth be filled with thy Praiſe all the Day long, O Lord, and without intermiſſion; and let us, with our Prophet here, expreſs the manner of our Thankſgiving: <hi>Let us take the Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord: Let us pay our Vows unto the Lord, now, in the preſence of all his People.</hi> And becauſe we can render him Nothing, let us render him a Confeſſion, That we can render him Nothing: For ſuch is the Longanimity and Forbearance of our heavenly Creditor, that if we do but acknowledg our <hi>Willingneſs</hi> along with our <hi>Inability</hi> to repay him, He will accept our <hi>Will</hi> for the <hi>Debt,</hi> and our <hi>bare Confeſſion</hi> for a <hi>full Diſcharge.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:33652:16"/>
            <p>Thus then let us do; Let us humble our ſelvs under his mighty Hand, confeſs our own Defects and Imperfections, and ſo give Him alone all Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the King Eternal, Immortal, Inviſible, the only Wiſe God, be all Honor and Glory, throughout all Ages.</hi>
